## Emily DiPressi 

Hello, I am Emily DiPressi a fourth year student studying History with a double minor in Anthropology and Digital Humanities. 

My data science project will hopefully be focused on something with a social justice theme, whether it is about crime, the environment, or access to resources. With my specializations in history and anthropology, I want to bring these injustices to light through the use of coding and creating meaningful visualizations that will display this data.

I hope to gain a greater knowledge in programming and coding. I believe having a background in Python will be a very beneficial asset in the job market, so I am hoping to learn enough to be able to use it. Producing an meaningful project from a dataset and using Python to create visualizations is my goal in the course.
