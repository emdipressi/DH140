## Emily DiPressi 

Hello, I am Emily DiPressi a fourth year student studying History with a double minor in Anthropology and Digital Humanities. 

My data science project will hopefully be focused on something with a social justice theme, whether it is about crime, the environment, or access to resources. With my specializations in history and anthropology, I want to bring these injustices to light through the use of coding and creating meaningful visualizations that will display this data.
