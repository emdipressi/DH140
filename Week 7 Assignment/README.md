# HyperCities 

## Emily DiPressi 

HyperCities shows the extent that digital humanities can have in the world, real time. I am so impressed with how fast the collection of Tweets in the Egypt incident happened. Learning about examples of digital humanities in the wild makes the subject seem more applicable and worthwhile topic in the real worldâ€”its not just theoretical or only classroom based. In the Egypt section, it was interesting how the event was categorized and understood as a network in order to understand it and visualize it. I think it is important when working with data such as this to reimagine it in a way that makes it easier to analyze and extrapolate information from it. 

How were the hashtags used determined?
