The article, “Explore the Role of Coding in Data Science and Analytics” gives a brief overview of data science and coding. Data science is defined as an area of study in which amounts of data are processed and analyzed in order to extract meaningful information from the datasets. Coding plays a major role in the field of data science. The article dissects some of the most integral aspects of data science including cleaning and visualizing data. The programming languages are also described. 

This article helped me understand the relation between the data science and coding. Before reading this article I was not aware of the close relation of the two and the different processes that occur in between having data and producing relevant information from the data. Python, also, seems to have many functions beyond what I initially thought it could do. After reading this article, I now value the capabilities of Python more and my base knowledge of Tableau, but I now want to have a greater proficiency in both programs.
